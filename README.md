# 50 Days of AWS Challenge – KodeKloud

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through the **50 Days of AWS Challenge by KodeKloud**.  
Each day focuses on a practical AWS task commonly encountered in real-world DevOps and cloud environments.

The goal of this challenge is to build **strong AWS fundamentals** by working on EC2, networking, storage, IAM, and security-related tasks using a structured, incremental approach.

---

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with core AWS services
- Understand real-world cloud infrastructure scenarios
- Follow best practices for security, networking, and cost optimization
- Build a well-documented and interview-ready AWS portfolio

---

## Repository Structure
- Each folder represents **one day** of the challenge
- Every day contains a dedicated `README.md` with:
  - Task / Requirement
  - Steps Performed
  - Learnings / Key Takeaways
